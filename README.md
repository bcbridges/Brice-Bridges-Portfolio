# [Brice-Bridges-Portfolio](https://bcbridges.github.io/Brice-Bridges-Portfolio/) Webpage

## Description of Project

This portfolio was designed to practice HTML & CSS markup, and for creating a beginning portfolio for our future projects.

### index.html

- The html was designed with flexbox layout in mind.
- Semantic tags were used when logical, and classes and ids were used in replacement of semantic elements when not available.

### style.css

- To create a responsive layout, fixed units (such as pixels) were avoided when possible. Relative based units (such as viewport and percentages) were used widely.
- Comments were used when possible in the css document to make logical breaks within the code for future devs.
- CSS variables were used throughout the rulesets to keep consistent, easy to call colors.
